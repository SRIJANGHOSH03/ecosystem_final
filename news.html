                    <p>As the first rays of the spring sun touch the tall chir pine trees (Pinus roxburgii) in the dense forests of Sunderbani in Jammu, residents living near the jungle, also get ready to spring into action. They strap on a long cloth called palle in the Dogri language, and several groups comprising both men and women leave their hutments to collect the dry pine needles (locally known as sarmoye) scattered across the forest floor.</p>

                    <p>Agroforestry, the amalgamation of agriculture and forestry within the same land area, may seem straightforward, yet its intricacies often require significant scientific intervention to optimise outcomes. Traditional methods for evaluating.</p>

                    <p>The Supreme Court, on February 19, directed the Union Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC) to revert to an older definition of forests whose protections were more “broad and all-encompassing”, as opposed to the more narrow definition in the amended Forest (Conservation) Act.</p>

                    <p>On the bank of the horseshoe-shaped Safrai river in the Chala village of Assam’s Charaideo district, stands a lush evergreen forest of over 680 hectares. Nearby, the rectangular shaped structure of a 152-year-old Theravāda Buddhist monastery hunkers down, under the shade of some old-growth trees. Half a decade ago, the then chief abbot of the monastery, Venerable Sasanavamsa Mahathera, expressed how the area had lost its dense forest cover over time.</p>

                    <p>The Dachigam National Park in Kashmir, surrounded by the lush Zabarwan mountains, stands out with its unique and diverse landscape. The protected area is an important conservation reserve serving as habitat for some endemic and endangered species in the valley. However, the park is now at risk from the increasing urbanisation in its vicinity.</p>
